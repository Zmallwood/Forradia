Model player body/danathomy:
* Have created stats for individual body parts: strength and energy. Arms determine what can be wielded in hands, and legs how fast player moves.
* Make strength stats increase on usage of skills.
* Make max energy level increase on usage of skills also.
* Make foods refill energy stats.
* Arms can have sub parts such as upper arms and hands.
* Legs can have sub parts such as upper legs and feet.
* Can maybe have awareness to increase spotting things when foraging.

* Consider making into MMO

* Fridge to store food, driven by electricity from water turbine or wind power or solar power
* Also, can be electric furnace, oven and other tools driven by electrity to make tools etc.
* Start with a cart with a fridge, electric furnace, oven etc, is its to heavey to carry in inventory

* Can be an idea that need to explore alot to find clay to make pots for cooking in the beginning,
and find metals such as copper, iron in mountains

* Can have certain areas which contains one type of creature, and spread the areas across the world map, so that one grind for different at different levels in different areas

* Maybe make a website for the game too to practice web development, where user can login to account, see character body status and world map etc.

* Eventually model the body with images instead of text
